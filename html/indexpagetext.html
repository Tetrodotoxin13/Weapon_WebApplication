          The game features two main modes: Plunder and Battle Royale. Warzone introduces a new in-game currency system called 
          "Cash" which is used at "Buy Stations" in and around Verdansk. "Loadout" drops are an example of where Cash can be traded for limited access to players' custom classes 
          (which were shared with Modern Warfare's standard modes prior to Season 6, v1.29, but now are unique to Warzone). Players may also use Cash to purchase items such as 
          "killstreaks" and gas masks. At launch, Warzone only offered Trios, a squad capacity of three players. 
          However, in free post launch content updates, Solos, Duos and Quads have all been added to the game.

        <h2>Maps</h2>
  
        <h5>Verdansk and Rebirth Island</h5>

        <p>
          Verdansk is the original Battle Royale map featured in the game, themed after the fictional city featured in the Modern Warfare campaign and multiplayer modes.
          The map is based on the real-life Donetsk city. Verdansk serves as the primary map for most of the game modes featured in Warzone.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Rebirth Island is the second map introduced in the game with the integration of Black Ops Cold War's contents. The map is based on the real-life Vozrozhdeniya Island, 
          which was also featured in the Call of Duty: Black Ops campaign mode. Unlike Verdansk, Rebirth Island is smaller in scale, only allowing 40 players maximum per match.

          There are 35 primary weapons and 10 secondary weapons in Call of Duty: Warzone, each with its own unique feel. 
          This weapons guide will give you all you need to know about each weapon and what its focus is.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Every player starts off with the X16 pistol with no attachments. Players can pick up every component found
          in a standard loadout (primary and secondary weapons, lethal and tactical equipment, field upgrades, and kill streaks) as
          they search the map for items located on the ground as well as in supply boxes found in designated locations. 
          Additional equipment unique to the Warzone game mode is shield plates. Three of these shield plates can be applied to a player 
          at a given time with the ability to carry five shields in the players' inventory, or eight if the player has found an armor satchel.
          Players can also pick up cash that can be used at buy stations for various purposes. Custom loadouts can 
          be acquired using random loadout drops (or bought from buy stations). 
          In Plunder, players spawn with custom loadouts, similar to regular Multiplayer modes.
        </p>

        <h2>PRIMARY Weapons</h2>
  
        <h5>From David to Goliath</h5>
  
        <img class="img-responsive" src="PicturesHome/Primary.jpg" alt="primary" style="width:100%">
  
        <p>
          You'll be using Primary weapons the most in Warzone. 
          These weapons are made up of the Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, LMGs, Marskman Rifles, Sniper Rifles and Melee weapons.
        </p>
      
        <h2>SECONDARY weapons</h2>
  
        <h5>Your first best friend</h5>
  
        <img class="img-responsive" src="PicturesHome/Secondary.png" alt="secondary" style="width:100%">
  
        <p> 
          Secondary Weapons are the weapons you'll likely be switching to when your 
          Primary Weapon is out of ammo or when you don't have time to reload yourfavorite assault rifle. 
          This class of weapons is made up of pistols, rocket launchers and Tactical Shileds.
